What do I want app to do

- Look at players in FA and be able to compare any number of players to each other
based on projected points
    - What UI elements do I need?
-Use ML to predict line performance in current and future weeks
- Create Rankings for FA's depending on the type of category
- Trade Simulator (EA Sports Franchise Mode) for both trades as FA Signings
- Chatbot that can answer questions that managers have
-



ask questions based on where they come from
(if they are emotional do not have the conversation)

listen to the other person and be empathetic

be cautious if people have same political view

thank you for sharing (if organizations ask for your support)
and share with dad to research about them

ask questions, listen, and let me think about context.
